# Dan's Dot File

This repo holds a few handy files that I like to keep synced between systems. At the moment it just has my vim config, but I may end up adding a few more items as time goes on.

## vim stuff
* symlink .vim folder and .vimrc file
<pre>
ln -s /path/to/repo/vim ~/.vim
ln -s /path/to/repo/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
</pre>
